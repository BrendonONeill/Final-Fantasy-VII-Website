# Final-Fantasy-VII-Website

This is a site I create to test out my website layout without a framework support and custom css.
The style of the website is based on Final fantasy 7 from the ps1 I wanted to mimic the style of the UI in the game it is a basic site that is similar to the manual that use to come with ps1 games.


## Still working on
Need to add a lightbox to the image gallery.
Will try expand the site more as I develope more skills in web layout.

## bugs
sidebar showing on larger screens. 
background images doesnt look great as it is stretched out. 
clean up the ui a bit.
